# NN & DL

HW1: Compare different architectures of fully connected networks by using [UTKFace Dataset](https://susanqq.github.io/UTKFace/) to determine the gender of an image and find the optimum architecture.

> Note: HW2 doesn't have the coding part.

HW3: Part A is about defining a convolutional neural network to classify images of CIFAR-10 dataset and also showing the two layers of feature maps. Part B is about adding Salt & Pepper noise to the images and then denoise them by a U-Net network.
